# Cybersecurity Risk Analysis of Robotic Vehicle Design Project

## Overview
This project began as a semester-long engineering assignment to design and build an Arduino-based robotic vehicle capable of autonomously or remotely navigating an obstacle course and retrieving objects. During my internship at FIS as an IT Security Analyst, I revisited this project and re-evaluated it through a cybersecurity lens.

The goal was to identify potential risks that could emerge if the robotic system were deployed in a real-world environment—such as signal hijacking, sensor spoofing, and other vulnerabilities and to assess how those risks could be mitigated using the industry-standard security framework ISO 27001:2022.

## What’s Included
- **Project Summary:** A detailed overview of the original project structure, agile roles, and outcomes.
- **Cybersecurity Application:** Analysis of potential risks (e.g., wireless compromise, camera hijacking, input injection).
- **ISO 27001 Mapping:** Controls from Annex A were mapped to real project risks.
- **Risk Register:** Spreadsheet listing key risks, control owners, and mitigation strategies.
- **Visual Mapping:** A security control matrix chart showing relationships to ISO 27001 domains.
