# Cybersecurity Risk Analysis of Robotic Vehicle Design Project

## Overview
This project revisits an engineering course assignment to build an autonomous robotic vehicle using Arduino. As part of my **IT Security Analyst Internship at FIS**, I applied cybersecurity principles to the project to demonstrate its relevance in securing embedded systems.

## What’s Included
- **Project Summary:** A detailed overview of the original project structure, agile roles, and outcomes.
- **Cybersecurity Application:** Analysis of potential risks (e.g., wireless compromise, camera hijacking, input injection).
- **ISO 27001 Mapping:** Controls from Annex A were mapped to real project risks.
- **Risk Register:** Spreadsheet listing key risks, control owners, and mitigation strategies.
- **Visual Mapping:** A security control matrix chart showing relationships to ISO 27001 domains.
